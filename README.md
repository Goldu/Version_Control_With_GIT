# Version Control with Git: A Python Developer's Guide

## Step 1: Installing Git

First, make sure you have Git installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the installation instructions.

## Step 2: Setting Up Git

After installation, open a terminal or command prompt and set your username and email. This information is used to identify your commits.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```

## Step 3: Creating a New Git Repository
Let's start by creating a new directory for your Python project.

```bash
mkdir my_python_project
cd my_python_project
```
Then, initialize a new Git repository.
```bash
git init
```
## Step 4: Adding Files
Create some Python files in your project directory. For example, let's create main.py.

```python
# main.py
def greet():
    print("Hello, Python!")
```
## 


```bash

```
